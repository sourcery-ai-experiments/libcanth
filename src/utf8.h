/** @brief UTF-8 parser states.
 *
 * The parser is implemented as a state machine with 15 operational
 * states and an initial state. The states are encoded as bit flags
 * in the byte value lookup table to track multi-byte sequences. In
 * other situations, state enumeration values are used directly.
 *
 * State enumerations 0 through 7 represent leading bytes, 8 through
 * 14 represent continuation bytes, and enumeration 15 is the initial
 * state. State enumerations 0, 14, and 15 can be followed by any one
 * of the 8 leading byte state enumerations. The remaining 13 states
 * (1 through 13) can be followed by exactly one state.
 *
 * Due to explicit restrictions in the UTF-8 encoding scheme, not all
 * leading byte values can be followed by any continuation byte value.
 * This is reflected in the presence of overlapping state transitions
 * in the table below.
 *
 * There are three distinct types of restrictions at play:
 *
 * 1. Overlong encodings are avoided by rejecting the leading bytes
 *    0xc0-0xc1 and 0xf5-0xff, and limiting the range of the first
 *    continuation byte following the leading bytes 0xe0 and 0xf0.
 *
 * 2. Surrogate code points are avoided by restricting the range of
 *    the first continuation byte following the leading byte 0xed.
 *
 * 3. Code points above the Unicode maximum of 0x10ffff are avoided
 *    by lowering the maximum value of the first continuation byte
 *    following the leading byte 0xf4.

 * - in the initial parser state (@ref utf8_ini), or
 * - after consuming an ASCII byte (@ref utf8_asc), or
 * - after consuming the last continuation byte of a multi-byte

 * In this situation the null byte is consumed, `u8p->error` is
 * assigned 0, and the address of the next byte after the null
 * byte is returned.
 *
 * If a null byte is encountered in any other situation it is
 * an illegal byte inside a multi-byte sequence. In this case
 * `u8p->error` is assigned `EILSEQ` and the address of the

 *
 * If the content of `u8p->state` is corrupt, `u8p->error` is
 * assigned `ENOTRECOVERABLE` and the original value of `ptr`
 * is returned. This is a serious error that should not occur
 * under normal circumstances. If this happens there is a bug
